# Eye Exercise

## Project Description
he original objective was to have a single eye track the location of the user's cursor. For an added layer of complexity, a second tracking eye is added for the eyes to look human. Both eyes are kept in sync thanks to a for-loop.

## How to Run
To run the program, begin by downloading this repository. Once installed, open index.html in a new browser tab and the two eyes will render upon launch. Move your cursor across the browser window to see the eyes track it. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future improvements can be adding a button to pause and resume the tracking, as well as creating a factory function to populate the program with more eyes.
